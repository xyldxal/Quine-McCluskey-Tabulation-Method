# CMSC 130 Quine-McCluskey Tabulation Method MP

The primary purpose of this program is to provide a powerful and efficient means of simplifying Boolean functions. Boolean functions, integral to digital logic design, often involve complex expressions that can be challenging to streamline. This program
leverages the Quine-McCluskey method to systematically reduce Boolean expressions to their most concise and simplified forms.

The program engages in a two-stage process to accomplish Boolean function simplification. In the initial stage, it employs the Quine-McCluskey method to identify prime implicants and iteratively refine the expression.
